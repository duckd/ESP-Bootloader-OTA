# ESP-Bootloader-OTA
 This project provides a minimal OTA-capable firmware for ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. After flashing it once via USB, the device starts in AP+STA mode and serves a simple web admin interface. Through this interface, users can securely upload new firmware over Wi-Fi, enabling fast and wireless reprogramming without physical access.
